                <p>I am an Italian Applied Computing student at WIT (Waterford of Technology) with a passion for programming. Over the past three years, I have immersed myself in the world of coding, acquiring proficiency in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Currently, as part of my studies in SETU (Software Engineering and Test Automation), I am expanding my knowledge by learning Java and C.</p>

                <p>Apart from my academic pursuits, music holds a special place in my heart. I have a diverse taste in music genres, including rap, funk, and pop. Some of my favorite artists include Tory Lanez and InterWorld, although I'm always open to discovering new sounds that find their way into my playlists.</p>

                <p>In addition to programming and music, I have various other passions and interests. Playing football has been an integral part of my life, and I enjoy participating in matches with different teams. Beyond the sports field, I also indulge in reading books related to the stock market and blockchain technology. Exploring these subjects allows me to broaden my horizons and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the financial and technological realms.</p>

                <p>Overall, I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student of applied computing, constantly striving to expand my programming skills and knowledge while embracing my varied interests outside of academia, and I was very fortunate to attend two very prestigious schools, the <b>International School of Stavanger</b> and <b>European School</b>.</p>
